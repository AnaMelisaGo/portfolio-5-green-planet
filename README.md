## Introduction

One of the major problems in our modern world that we are facing right now is the massive waste we all produce each day and it has a terrible impact on our environment. One third of our yearly food supply is thrown away to the garbage and this is not good for our society and to our environment.

In this project, the main goal is to reduce food waste that restaurants, grocery stores, hotels and even bakery stores produce everyday and aren’t consumed totally and most of these products are thrown away in the trash. In short, we are rescuing the leftovers or surplus food.

This project is mainly an online ecommerce food shopping site. To achieve our goal, this site offers promotions to consumers who want low cost food products and goods, especially for those who have a low budget each month. It’s a good way to help those who are in need of a nice good meal.

Businesses will also have benefits in this action due to the fact that all products and goods that aren’t totally consumed or sold inside their business (restaurant, hotel, stores etc) are going to be sold through this website and are not wasted away. Businesses will still gain profit from the surplus or leftovers. Nothing should be thrown away as food production costs money, time and lots of effort.

### Favicon
 
![Favicon Image](static/images/favicon.ico)

The favicon used in this project is the same as the logo of the website to give it a sense of uniformity.
 
### Functionality of Project
This application contains a home button, the store, login button or sign up button for the consumers who are interested in purchasing food from the website, and a section for businesses. The additional information about the webpage can be found in the home page to engage the user to browse more without going to any other pages and for them to stay longer in the website. A search bar is available in the navbar so the user can search for any food or stores.

The Store section shows all the promotions available and can be filtered by the different business types like restaurants, hotels, supermarket, bakery etc who want to sell their unconsumed or unsold products. Can also be filtered by the store name, business type category, ratings and price.

The user can add items in the bag and continue to search and add more contents to it. Payment can be done through the bag itself or the notification pop up for easy access. After making the payment, a transaction number is provided to the consumer for pick up. An email confirmation is also sent to the user in case an error occurs and the website is not working well. It is explained in the FAQ section the reason why home delivery is not available.

This application also offers to businesses or companies to join the company’s mission against food waste and sell their unsold or unconsumed products. They can contact us by filling up the form to provide them with the best solution for their business.

When a user registers to the website, the user can browse to the user profile page. In this page, the user can view the contact details, the history and favourites. The user can also make changes to their contact details. If the user is an admin or superuser, this user is given access from this page to create new stores to sell food, edit and delete, create a new business type category and edit them if needed.

The footer has different links to browse for the users' additional information about the website, FAQ, terms and privacy policy. It has social media icons that are also available for the user to browse through the different social media platforms. A subscriber form is also available in the footer for the user to subscribe to newsletter easily.

#### Design
 
##### 1. Font

The font used for this project is basic and easy to recognize. I used Google fonts Lato with a 400 regular thickness.
 
##### 2. Color Scheme

![Color Schema](media/readme-files/color-schema.jpg)

The color schema was inspired by the colors of a dark night forest. Dark green and dark blue are used to give depth and intensity. The light colors is to give contrast from the dark colors. New colors were added during the development.

`#e7f0e3` is a very light green used for the webpage background

`#946C3E` is a light brown used to enfasize some links and the navbar active page css style

`#99C233` is a neon green used in the navbar
 
##### 3. Logo
The logo was created using the LogoDesigner app with templates to use for free. It  creates a png image with great resolution. The logo for this project  was designed to appear as a globe to simulate the shape of the planet as the name of the company. The circular shape is formed by forks to give more meaning to the purpose of this project.

## Features
 
The project boasts several key features:
* Create: ...

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### Web Marketing

For this ecommerce project I have chosen to use free web marketing strategies. These are:

   - SEO and content marketing
   - Social media marketing
   - Email newsletter subscription

#### SEO IMPLEMENTATION

Some of the tecniques for SEO implementation for this project is done by using semantic HTML, minimize the keyword stuff but use these keywords in natural sentences in content of the website, use descriptive alt attribute for images, use metadata description and keyword on the head level of the project and using noopener in rel and descriptive aria-label attributes for external links.

The keywords are short-tailed and long-tailed for this project, and after much deliberation these keywords are as follows:
      
   - leftovers, low cost, save food, reduce waste, save planet, great discount food, unsold good, guaranteed low price, surplus food, unsold food from restaurants, great discount products from supermarkets,
   fight food waste.

For a good SEO implementation robots.txt is also added at the project root level which tells search engine crawlers which URLs the crawler can access on the website. This is used mainly to avoid overloading the site with requests; it is not a mechanism for keeping a web page out of Google.

Sitemap.xml was also included in the project root level. It is a file that lists a website’s essential pages, making sure Google can find and crawl them all. It also helps search engines understand your website structure. You want Google to crawl every important page of your website. But sometimes, pages end up without internal links pointing to them, making them hard to find. A sitemap can help speed up content discovery.

<br>

#### Social Media Marketing

The social media platform chosen for web marketing was Facebook, because it has the largest number of users and the widest demographic. The purpose of a Facebook bussines page is to get potential customers attention on the business and to promote company's products and services. The facebook page was created using my personal facebook page. Deactivated after taking screenshot.

![Facebook page of Green Planet](media/readme-files/green-planet-fb-page.jpg)

<br>

#### Email Marketing

The use of email within the ecommerce projects is to promote a business’s products and services, as well as customer loyalty. Email marketing is a  a key pillar of your digital marketing strategy. It is a form of marketing that can make the customers on your email list aware of new products, discounts, and other services.

Mailchimp was used for the subscription form for newsletter that can help optimize email marketing to get the best marketing program.

### Future Features:
 
* For future features not implemente and this is included in the user story: REVIEWS. Due to the limited time, I couldn't start to implement it. For this feature it would be nice to have a review section where user who have tried the food from a store can leave a review and ratings.

* I could have added more shipping details and more billing details to be able to include home delivery to any orders, but as time was very limited changing the code and trying to make it work would take a lot of time. So for future feature I leave this to be implemented.

* Add more store in the store page to offer more promos and discounted food to customers.

* Expand the FAQ content thus it is not complete, and fix the scrollspy problem and the UI of this page is not good.

* Add a blog section where admin, shoppers, or guests can browse to any interesting content regarding food saving, money saving, keeping the environment clean and reducing food waste at home or inside their businesses. 
 
## Testing
 
Testing was carried out manually throughout the development of this project. Constant testing was done using Chrome Dev tools. Tested the website in different devices and sizes. Testing was carried out with the following validators:

   - PEP8 python Validator

   - W3C Markup and CSS Validator

   - JSHint Validator

All validity tests passed.

#### Found Bugs and Fixes:
 
During manual testing some minor and major bugs was encountered.

## Deployment
 
The project's repo was hosted on GitHub and it was deployed on Heroku

### Heroku Setup and CLI

Deploying Python to GitHub itself won't work, since Github can only handle front-end files such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. So this project it needs to be deployed to a hosting platform that can render Python files. One such platform is [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login).

- sign up / login to [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login) website to create or login to your account
- if necessary, install the heroku CLI in Gitpod: `curl https://cli-assets.heroku.com/install.sh | sh`
- login to Heroku CLI: `heroku login -i`

### Create database with ElephantSQL
 1. Log in to ElephantSQL.com to access dashboard.

 2. Click “Create New Instance”.

 3. Set up plan

      - Give it a Name (this is commonly the name of the project)

      - Select the Tiny Turtle (Free) plan

      - Leave the Tags field blank

4. Select “Select Region”.

5. Select the nearest data center.

6. Click "Review".

7. Check details are correct and then click “Create instance”.


### Creating a Heroku App

A Heroku app can be created in CLI or on [Heroku website](https://id.heroku.com)

1. Click New to create a new app.

2. Give app a name and select closest region. When done, click Create app to confirm. Heroku app names must be unique.

#### Create Heroku app in CLI
- In the terminal: `heroku apps:create app-name --region eu`
- view the apps in CLI: `heroku apps`
- view the key remotes in CLI: `git remote -v`

### Connecting Database on Heroku

1. Open the Settings tab in the Heroku app

2. Add the config var DATABASE_URL, and for the value, copy in the database url from ElephantSQL.

### Installing Project Requirements

The `db.sqlite3` database cannot be used in Heroku and Heroku had ended their free tier offerings for deployment with its platform. We used ElephantSQL instead of Postgres for this project.

- install a database url package: `pip3 install dj-database-url==0.5.0 psycopg2` - this package allows us to parse the database url that Heroku created
- refreeze the requirements file: `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`
- in `settings.py`
   - import "dj_database_url" underneath import os
   - comment out the original "DATABASE" settings and paste in ` DATABASES = {
     'default': dj_database_url.parse('your-database-url-here')
   }`. DO NOT commit this file with your database string in the code, this is temporary
   - run migrations: `python3 manage.py migrate`
   - Create a superuser for your new database `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`.
   - To prevent exposing the database when pushing to GitHub, delete it again from settings.py and uncomment the original "DATABASE".
   - Check ElephantSQL to confirm database is created

### Deployment to Heroku
1. In `settings.py` delete the database created and replace it with:

`if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
    DATABASES = {
     'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
    }
else:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
        }
    }`

2. install webserver: `pip3 install gunicorn` - replaces the development server once the app is deployed to Heroku

3. run `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt` - creates a file to let heroku know which packages to install.

4. Create Procfile file

5. Add this code for Heroku to create web dyno: `web: gunicorn green_planet.wsgi:application`

6. Go to Heroku, settings , config var and add variable:
`COLLECTSTATIC` : 1 ,so that Heroku won't try to collect staticfiles when we deploy.

7. Add the hostname of the Heroku app to `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in settings.py

8. Push the code to Github

9. In the terminal run: `heroku git:remote -a heroku-app-name`

10. git push heroku main to deploy to heroku

### Connecting Heroku to Github

By connecting Heroku to Github the application will automatically deploy the latest code to Heroku.

1. In heroku app, open app, in "Deploy" tab, under the "Deployment method" setting select "GitHub"

2. Search for repository and click "Connect"

3. Choose "Enable Automatic Deploys"

### Config vars

Config vars are needed to be created in Heroku so that to conect the app to Django, AWS, stripe and email.
